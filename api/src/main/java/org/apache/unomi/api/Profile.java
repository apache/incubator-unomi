/**
 * A user profile gathering all known information about a given user as well as segments it is part of and scores.
 * <p>
 * Contrary to other unomi {@link Item}s, profiles are not part of a scope since we want to be able to track the associated user across applications. For this reason, data
 * collected for a given profile in a specific scope is still available to any scoped item that accesses the profile information.
 * <p>
 * It is interesting to note that there is not necessarily a one to one mapping between users and profiles as users can be captured across applications and different observation
 * contexts. As identifying information might not be available in all contexts in which data is collected, resolving profiles to a single physical user can become complex because
 * physical users are not observed directly. Rather, their portrait is progressively patched together and made clearer as unomi captures more and more traces of their actions.
 * Unomi will merge related profiles as soon as collected data permits positive association between distinct profiles, usually as a result of the user performing some identifying
 * action in a context where the user hadnâ€™t already been positively identified.
