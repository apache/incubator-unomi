=== Configuration

==== Changing the default configuration

If you want to change the default configuration, you can perform any modification you want in the $MY_KARAF_HOME/etc directory.

The context server configuration is kept in the $MY_KARAF_HOME/etc/org.apache.unomi.web.cfg . It defines the
addresses and port where it can be found :

[source]
----
contextserver.address=localhost
contextserver.port=8181
contextserver.secureAddress=localhost
contextserver.securePort=9443
contextserver.domain=apache.org
----

If you need to specify an Elasticsearch cluster name that is different than the default, it is recommended to do this
BEFORE you start the server for the first time, or you will loose all the data you have stored previously.

To change the cluster name, first create a file called

[source]
----
$MY_KARAF_HOME/etc/org.apache.unomi.persistence.elasticsearch.cfg
----

with the following contents:

[source]
----
cluster.name=contextElasticSearch
index.name=context
elasticSearchConfig=file:${karaf.etc}/elasticsearch.yml
----

And replace the cluster.name parameter here by your cluster name.

You can also put an elasticsearch configuration file in $MY_KARAF_HOME/etc/elasticsearch.yml ,
and put any standard Elasticsearch configuration options in this last file.

If you want your context server to be a client only on a cluster of elasticsearch nodes, just set the node.data property
to false.

==== Installing the MaxMind GeoIPLite2 IP lookup database

The Context Server requires an IP database in order to resolve IP addresses to user location.
The GeoLite2 database can be downloaded from MaxMind here :
http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/[http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/]

Simply download the GeoLite2-City.mmdb file into the "etc" directory.

==== Installing Geonames database

Context server includes a geocoding service based on the geonames database ( http://www.geonames.org/[http://www.geonames.org/] ). It can be
used to create conditions on countries or cities.

In order to use it, you need to install the Geonames database into . Get the "allCountries.zip" database from here :
http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/[http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/]

Download it and put it in the "etc" directory, without unzipping it.
Edit $MY_KARAF_HOME/etc/org.apache.unomi.geonames.cfg and set request.geonamesDatabase.forceImport to true, import should start right away.
Otherwise, import should start at the next startup. Import runs in background, but can take about 15 minutes.
At the end, you should have about 4 million entries in the geonames index.

==== REST API Security

The Context Server REST API is protected using JAAS authentication and using Basic or Digest HTTP auth.
By default, the login/password for the REST API full administrative access is "karaf/karaf".

The generated package is also configured with a default SSL certificate. You can change it by following these steps :

.

Replace the existing keystore in $MY_KARAF_HOME/etc/keystore by your own certificate :

http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/Configure_SSL[http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/Configure_SSL]

.

Update the keystore and certificate password in $MY_KARAF_HOME/etc/custom.properties file :

[source]
----
    org.osgi.service.http.secure.enabled = true
    org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keystore=${karaf.etc}/keystore
    org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.password=changeme
    org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keypassword=changeme
    org.osgi.service.http.port.secure=9443
----

You should now have SSL setup on Karaf with your certificate, and you can test it by trying to access it on port 9443.

==== Automatic profile merging

The context server is capable of merging profiles based on a common property value. In order to use this, you must
add the MergeProfileOnPropertyAction to a rule (such as a login rule for example), and configure it with the name
 of the property that will be used to identify the profiles to be merged. An example could be the "email" property,
 meaning that if two (or more) profiles are found to have the same value for the "email" property they will be merged
 by this action.

Upon merge, the old profiles are marked with a "mergedWith" property that will be used on next profile access to delete
the original profile and replace it with the merged profile (aka "master" profile). Once this is done, all cookie tracking
will use the merged profile.

To test, simply configure the action in the "login" or "facebookLogin" rules and set it up on the "email" property.
Upon sending one of the events, all matching profiles will be merged.

==== Securing a production environment

Before going live with a project, you should _absolutely_ read the following section that will help you setup a proper
secure environment for running your context server.

Step 1: Install and configure a firewall

You should setup a firewall around your cluster of context servers and/or Elasticsearch nodes. If you have an
application-level firewall you should only allow the following connections open to the whole world :

* http://localhost:8181/cxs/context.js[http://localhost:8181/cxs/context.js]
* http://localhost:8181/cxs/eventcollector[http://localhost:8181/cxs/eventcollector]

All other ports should not be accessible to the world.

For your Context Server client applications (such as the Jahia CMS), you will need to make the following ports
accessible :

[source]
----
8181 (Context Server HTTP port)
9443 (Context Server HTTPS port)
----

The context server actually requires HTTP Basic Auth for access to the Context Server administration REST API, so it is
highly recommended that you design your client applications to use the HTTPS port for accessing the REST API.

The user accounts to access the REST API are actually routed through Karaf's JAAS support, which you may find the
documentation for here :

* http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/users-guide/security.html[http://karaf.apache.org/manual/latest/users-guide/security.html]

The default username/password is

[source]
----
karaf/karaf
----

You should really change this default username/password as soon as possible. To do so, simply modify the following
file :

[source]
----
$MY_KARAF_HOME/etc/users.properties
----

For your context servers, and for any standalone Elasticsearch nodes you will need to open the following ports for proper
node-to-node communication : 9200 (Elasticsearch REST API), 9300 (Elasticsearch TCP transport)

Of course any ports listed here are the default ports configured in each server, you may adjust them if needed.

Step 2 : Adjust the Context Server IP filtering

By default the Context Server limits to connections to port 9200 and 9300 to the following IP ranges

[source]
----
- localhost
- 127.0.0.1
- ::1
- the current subnet (i.e., 192.168.1.0-192.168.1.255)
----

(this is done using a custom plugin for Elasticsearch, that you may find here :
https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-unomi/context-server/persistence-elasticsearch/plugins/security[https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-unomi/context-server/persistence-elasticsearch/plugins/security])

You can adjust this setting by using the following setting in the $MY_KARAF_HOME/etc/elasticsearch.yml file :

[source]
----
security.ipranges: localhost,127.0.0.1,::1,10.0.1.0-10.0.1.255
----

Step 3 : Follow industry recommended best practices for securing Elasticsearch

You may find more valuable recommendations here :

* https://www.elastic.co/blog/scripting-security[https://www.elastic.co/blog/scripting-security]

Step 4 : Setup a proxy in front of the context server

As an alternative to an application-level firewall, you could also route all traffic to the context server through
a proxy, and use it to filter any communication.

==== Integrating with an Apache HTTP web server

If you want to setup an Apache HTTP web server in from of Apache Unomi, here is an example configuration using
mod_proxy.

In your Unomi package directory, in /etc/org.apache.unomi.web.cfg for unomi.apache.org

contextserver.address=unomi.apache.org
 contextserver.port=80
 contextserver.secureAddress=unomi.apache.org
 contextserver.securePort=443
 contextserver.domain=apache.org

Main virtual host config:

[source]
----
<VirtualHost *:80>
        Include /var/www/vhosts/unomi.apache.org/conf/common.conf
</VirtualHost>

<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    <VirtualHost *:443>
        Include /var/www/vhosts/unomi.apache.org/conf/common.conf

        SSLCertificateChainFile /var/www/vhosts/unomi.apache.org/conf/ssl/gd_bundle-g2-g1.crt

        <FilesMatch "\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|php)$">
                SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
        </FilesMatch>
        <Directory /usr/lib/cgi-bin>
                SSLOptions +StdEnvVars
        </Directory>
        BrowserMatch "MSIE [2-6]" \
                nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
                downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0
        BrowserMatch "MSIE [17-9]" ssl-unclean-shutdown

    </VirtualHost>
</IfModule>
----
