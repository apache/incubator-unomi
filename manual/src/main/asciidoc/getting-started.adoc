=== Getting started with Unomi

We will first get you up and running with an example. We will then lift the corner of the cover somewhat and explain
in greater details what just happened.

==== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are already familiar with Unomi's <<_concepts,concepts>>. On the technical side, we
also assume working knowledge of https://git-scm.com/[git] to be able to retrieve the code for Unomi and the example.
Additionally, you will require a working Java 7 or above install. Refer to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/] for details on how to download and install Java SE 7 or greater.

==== Running Unomi

===== Start Unomi

Start Unomi according to the <<_5-min-quickstart,5 minute quick start>> or by compiling using the building link:building-and-deploying.html#Deploying_the_generated_package[instructions]. Once you have Karaf running,
 you should wait until you see the following messages on the Karaf console:

[source]
----
Initializing user list service endpoint...
Initializing geonames service endpoint...
Initializing segment service endpoint...
Initializing scoring service endpoint...
Initializing campaigns service endpoint...
Initializing rule service endpoint...
Initializing profile service endpoint...
Initializing cluster service endpoint...
----

This indicates that all the Unomi services are started and ready to react to requests. You can then open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8181/cxs` to see the list of
available RESTful services or retrieve an initial context at `http://localhost:8181/context.json` (which isn't very useful at this point).

Now that your service is up and running you can go look at the <<_request-examples,request examples>> to learn basic
requests you can do once your server is up and running.
